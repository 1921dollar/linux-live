Linux Live Kit
==============

Use this set of scripts to turn your existing preinstalled Linux
distribution into a Live Kit (formely known as Live CD).

* Before you start building your Kit, edit the file ./.config

* You may also wish to replace boot graphics in ./bootfiles/bootlogo.png
  and reorganize isolinux.cfg to fit your needs (when editing the file,
  keep all paths in /boot/, it will be rellocated during LiveKit creation)

* If you plan to boot your Live Kit from CD, you need to recompile
  syslinux.bin to include your target path. There is a script prepared
  for you which will handle all of that. Simply go to directory ./tools/
  and run isolinux.bin.update ... it will update your isolinux.bin
  automatically by downloading isolinux sources, patching them using
  your actual LIVEKITNAME and recompiling. It will copy the new isolinux.bin
  binary to bootfiles for you as well.

* When done, run the ./build script to create your Live Kit
