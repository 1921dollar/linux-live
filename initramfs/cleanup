# This script must be executed with parameter "--start" at the end of distro shutdown
# What it does is it executes as init (process 1) and unmounts all filesystems
# including union and the USB device (if any), so it can be cleanly removed
#
# Simply add the following as the last command executed by init on your distro
# instead of the actual poweroff or shutdown command:
#
#       /mnt/live/lib/cleanup --start poweroff
#    or
#       /mnt/live/lib/cleanup --start shutdown
#
#    on Slackware, add this to rc.0:
#       /mnt/live/lib/cleanup --start /sbin/$command
#

   # this is our first call. We will setup everything so the actual init actually
   # reloads, but calls this script again instead of itself
