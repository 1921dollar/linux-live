 Welcome

 If you need to edit boot command line (for advanced users), hit [Tab].
 When finished, navigate to "Run Slax" menu row and press [Enter].


 Persistent changes

 Save all filesystem modifications to 'changes' directory and restore
 those changes next time you boot. Only usable while running from a
 writable media such as USB device or hard disk.


 Copy to RAM

 Copies all data to memory during startup so you can eject the boot device.
 Make sure to uncheck persistent changes (see above) else your boot device
 will be still in use.
